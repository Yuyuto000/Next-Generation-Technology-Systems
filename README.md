# Next-Generation-Technology-Systems
Building next-generation information technology systems.
# Amazing placeü§ñ
This project has an API built in, which can be used in a variety of situations.
It also has built-in web embedding, allowing you to incorporate the system into your website.
And rightly so, this project is based on a computer system (the one that hackers get into) and has many different functions implemented, making it very easy to use.
# Featuresüåê
This next-generation computer system consists of the following features:

**1.AI Dialogue**
This mechanism is at the heart of this large-scale system and faithfully answers a variety of questions.
Advanced API settings are available, allowing you to customize responses based on the user's mood.
Ultimately, you can customize it so that everything works just with voice.
What's more, it has an amazing feature that allows you to generate voice responses, images, videos, and codes as needed in addition to text.
This kind of AI that can be used in everyday life is the highlight feature.

**2.Game-professionalAI**
This is a function that allows you to install a new AI engine specialized for games, using the previous AI as the base model. Since the API requests are already included in the code, it can perform functions just like a human.
If you incorporate this AI into the previous basic AI model, you will not be able to incorporate an AI that exclusively provides functions other than this one.
Please be careful.
